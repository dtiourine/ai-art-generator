Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images of art.

## Reference for self

# Next steps:
- **Retrain and adjust model to this time use an input image shape of 224 instead of 64 (so change image size hyperparameter)**
- Add script/instructions for downloading model/data
- Add requirements.txt file
- Finish up READme (both this one and the one remember the one in /src)
- To dependencies mention that a kaggle key is required to download dataset. Alternatively can download dataset at the website. Maybe put some sort of warning in setup_assets.py that there was an issue with downloading data from Kaggle (if there is one), and only model was installed

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started 

### 1. Install dependencies 

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download assets (pretrained model + dataset) 

```bash 
python setup_assets.py
```

This will: 
- Download the pretrained GAN model into the `models/` folder
- Download and extract the training dataset into `data/`

## ðŸš€ Running Locally

### ðŸ”„ Quick Start (Recommended)

To launch both the **FastAPI backend** and the **HTML frontend** locally with one command to interact with the art generator:

```
python run_dev.py
```

This will:
- Set the correct `PYTHONPATH` for clean imports
- Start the FastAPI server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Serve the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Make sure you are in the **project root** directory when you run the command.

---

### ðŸ›  Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run everything manually, follow the steps below:

#### 1. Start FastAPI Backend

Run this from the **project root directory**:

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. fastapi dev app/main.py
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```bash
$env:PYTHONPATH="." 
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

This starts the backend at:  
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

#### 2. Start Frontend (Static HTML)

In a new terminal, navigate to the `static/` folder and run:

```bash
cd static 
python -m http.server 3000
```

This starts the frontend at:  
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The frontend can now communicate with the FastAPI backend to generate images.
